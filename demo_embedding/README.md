# Demo Embeddings

You can find all pretrained models in `pretrained_models` directory. Training from scratch and Finetuning can be done using the `exp_training_from_scratch.py` and `exp_finetuning.py` scripts respectively. Evaluation can be done using the `evaluate.py` script.

The code is still being cleaned up. You would probably need to change directories paths and datasets in the code to make it work, but all definitions and necessary codes should be there.
